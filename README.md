# AquaRadar – Real-Time Fish Market Price Tracker

AquaRadar is a web application that tracks and compares fish prices across coastal districts. It helps buyers, sellers, and market observers identify the best market with the highest price for a selected fish in real-time.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

In many coastal regions, fish prices vary dramatically across different markets. Without centralized, accessible data:
- Sellers may unknowingly sell for less.
- Buyers can't find optimal prices.
- Transparency is limited across districts.

🧠 **Solution**: FishRadar fetches and displays fish prices on an interactive map, highlights the best price, and enhances market awareness.
